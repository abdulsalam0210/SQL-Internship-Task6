# ðŸ§© SQL Internship Task 6 â€” Subqueries and Nested Queries

This project demonstrates the use of **subqueries** and **nested queries** in SQL to perform advanced data retrieval.  
It explores scalar, correlated, and multi-level subqueries within the **E-Commerce Database Schema** used in previous tasks.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

The goal of this task is to strengthen understanding of:
- Subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses  
- `IN` and `EXISTS` operators  
- Scalar vs. correlated subqueries  
- Derived tables (subqueries in `FROM`)  
- Multi-level nested queries
